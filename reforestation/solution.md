# Reforestation

## Definitions
- **seed production area (SPA).**
- **outplanting.** the permanent placement of nursery-grown seedlings on the reforestation site.

## Notes
- We need to increase tree seedling production to 3B seedlings (for reforestation by 2040), or 5.1B seedlings (for reforestation by 2050). [1]
    - Current production is around 1.3B seedlings. [1]
    - Seedling production peaked in the 1980s at 2.6B seedlings a year. [1]
- The pipeline of reforestation:
    1. seed collection and storage
    2. nursery production
    3. outplanting
    4. post-planting treatment and monitoring
- The U.S. has approximately 26 million ha of reforestable land.
- Price of reforestation is around $2000 per ha.
