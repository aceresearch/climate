## Social science research: Policy 
- [Fossil Fuel Industry stalling action; IPCC report](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/ipcc-report-scientists-climate-crisis-fossil-fuels)

## Pareto principle
- Industrial emissions contribute 33% of global CO2 emissions.
- 50% of industrial emissions come from producing the following four products
    1. concrete
    2. steel
    3. ammonia
    4. ethylene

## Fermi estimates
- humanity has manufactured over **8 billion metric tons (1000 kg)** of plastic (2020)
- the next 8 billion metric tons will be produced in only **15 years**

## Prong 1: Mitigation (Reducing CO2 in the atmosphere)

## Prong 2: Adaptation (Protecting ourselves from the effects of CO2)
