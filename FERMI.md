## Numbers

### Emissions
- In 2004, the world emitted 25 billion metric tons of CO2.
  - This is when the stabilization wedges article was written.
- In 2021, the world emitted 36 billion metric tons of CO2.

### Fuel sources
- 1000 kg of coal produces 1927 kWh.
- 1 barrel of residual fuel oil (used in container ships) produces 578 kWh.
- 1000 cubic feet of natural gas produces 99 kWh.

- We want to plant approximately 1000 trees in every hectare.
- It costs a dollar to plant a tree.
- Forest can sequester 6 metric tons per hectare per year.
  - We need to plant 6 billion ha of forest.
- The Earth originally had 6B ha of forest; we are now at 4B ha.

### Energy use
- The average annual electricity consumption of an American is 11000 kWh.
- A desktop computer uses 600 kWh of energy a year.
  - 5% of the energy used by an American.
