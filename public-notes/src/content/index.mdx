## Climate primer: A call to action

### How much time do we have?

As of May 2023, the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) estimates that the atmosphere can only absorb 260 Gt more of $\ce{CO2}$ if we are to stay below the 1.5ÂºC threshold<Footnote id={1} />. At our current  estimated emission rate of around 50 Gt of $\ce{CO2}$ per year, that gives us **5.2 years** to develop **technology and policy** to drastically reduce our carbon emissions.

### Where should we focus our efforts?
